The TUCS Dissertation Latex Template
====================================

This is an updated version of the [TUCS dissertation template](http://tucs.fi/publications/publishing-series/tucsdiss_latex_2007.zip) from the [TUCS document templates page](http://tucs.fi/education/information-students/document-templates/). It can be used by TUCS graduate school students for preparing their dissertations.

Features
--------

In this version, the most important additions to the original TUCS template are macros for including the reprints, and automated generation of the publication lists from a BibTex bibliography.

The main file of the template is `diss.tex`. The precompiled `diss.pdf` shows what the template should look like if compilation works. For documentation on how to use the template, please see the tex source files.

History
-------

The original template from 2007 was extended with macros and improvements by Filip Ginter when making his thesis. That version was further extended by Jari Bj√∂rne when writing his thesis. The history of this repository
starts from the original 2007 TUCS template, with further additions contained in separate commits.
